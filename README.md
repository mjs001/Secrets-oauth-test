# Secrets-oauth-test
Submit your secrets! Complete with Facebook and Google Oauth!
Created with EJS, Node, CSS, JS, Mongoose, and Passport.

## How to get started:
Since this is a conceptual app for me to experiment with Oauth, I have not published this app as I would need to submit the app for review with Google and Meta. This means that in order to get the app working you would need to either have a remote MongoDB DB or MongoDB installed for local use. You would also need to sign up for and register the project with [Google Cloud Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started) and the [Facebook Developers page](https://developers.facebook.com/).

### Environment Variables that need to be filled out:

- **SECRET** This refers to a string of your choosing that will be used to sign the session cookie. Preferably, make it a random string of characters.
- **CLIENT_ID** This refers to the autogenerated Client ID in the Google Dev console inside the app you have created for this project.
- **CLIENT_SECRET** This refers to the autogenerated Client Secret in the Google Dev console inside the app you have created for this project.
- **FACEBOOK_APP_ID** This refers to the autogenerated App ID in the Facebook Dev page inside the app you have created for this project.
- **FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET** This refers to the autogenerated App Secret in the Facebook Dev page inside the app you have created for this project.
- **CALLBACK_URL_FB** This refers to a callback defined by you in the Facebook Dev page, on your app, go to "App settings" => "Basic" => scroll down to bottom click "Add platform" => select "Website" => the URL you enter here should be **your domain localhost or otherwise/auth/facebook/secrets**
- **CALLBACK_URL_G** This refers to a callback defined by you in the Google Cloud Dev Console, on your project, go to "APIs and Services" => "Credentials" => add URI to "Authorized JavaScript origins" if localhost then: **http://localhost:3000**  => then add URI to "Authorized redirect URIs" => the URI you enter here should be **your domain localhost or otherwise/auth/google/secrets**
- **DATABASE_URL** This is the URL of your DB, if it is localhost: **mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/insert a DB name**
